# HubSpot Capstone Project

HubSpot would like to increase their presence in emerging markets, particularly Brazil and India. Research indicates several areas where HubSpot can optimize cost, spending, marketing, and resource allocation in order to increase their LTV (Customer Lifetime Value) to CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) ratio (“health index”) to above four. 

**Purpose:**

Our goal is to help HubSpot optimize their cost and pricing structure, increase the business revenue, and ultimately secure a sustainable business success. As the health index manifestly indicates how healthy HubSpot’s business is in the emerging markets, our specific purposes in this project would be: 

1) Evaluating HubSpot’s LTV:CAC ratio in the Brazilian and Indian emerging markets;

2) Optimizing the cost and pricing structure by increasing the LTV:CAC ratio to 4 times or greater; 

3) Proposing internal and external strategies based on the data-driven insights.

**Methodology:**

Three main steps: Data Preparation, Data Analysis, and Strategy Formulation. Initially, we cleaned the dataset and recategorized the data by company size and industry. We utilized Tableau and R to analyze correlations, statistical significance, revenue seasonality, and segmentation based on company size and industry. This process resulted us in 
finalizing visualizations that depicted key trends for sales and marketing strategies for each country. 

**Strategy & Recommendation:**
